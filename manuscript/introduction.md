# Introduction

## The Author

I've programmed computers for a while. When I was 6, on the same day I wrote my first computer program at a workshop my father took me to, I saw Star Wars (IV) at the cinema. A day like that has an impact on a person's life.

Other days also burrowed their way into my mind. An amazing local ballet. The copper art my mother made. The 1983 movie "Staying Alive". The first time I saw a shaven-head beuaty fire twirl. Listening to "The Final Cut" by Pink Floyd for the first time.

There's a clear thread here. I love the arts, and I consider the product of programming as art. Art is where one or more people express themselves through any medium, and find an appreciative audience.

I only program because it fulfills my need to produce art, to perform, and to be appreciated. I've produced a lot more art than just programs. I have danced, lit performances, staged shows with my collegues. I've twirled fire and juggled and busked. 

Thankfully, I was able to make an income with one of my artistic passions. For this reason, I feel vaguely qualified to write about it.
