# Introduction

## The Author

I've programmed computers for a while. When I was 6, on the same day I wrote my first computer program at a workshop my father took me to, I saw Star Wars (IV) at the cinema. A day like that has an impact on a person's life.

Other days also burrowed their way into my mind. An amazing local ballet. The copper art my mother made. The 1983 movie "Staying Alive". The first time I saw a shaven-head beuaty fire twirl. Listening to "The Final Cut" by Pink Floyd for the first time.

There's a clear thread here. I love the arts, and I consider the product of programming as art. Art is where one or more people express themselves through any medium, and find an appreciative audience.

I only program because it fulfills my need to produce art, to perform, and to be appreciated. I've produced a lot more art than just programs. I have danced, lit performances, staged shows with my collegues. I've twirled fire and juggled and busked. 

Thankfully, I was able to make an income with one of my artistic passions. For this reason, I feel vaguely qualified to write about it.

## The art of performance

Imagine the audience at a rock concert for a while. Picture those new to the band, brought along by friends perhaps. What about those in attendance who adore the band that's playing. Some of those present may themselves be in a band. This one girl in the crowd is incredibly talented on guitar. Another member of the audience and expert in Flamenco guitar, not rock. Imagine the different ways that a considerable number of people may appreciate the same art. 

I've always been a fan of band lighting. I pay close attention to how the lighting designer, and the operators, stage and perform. Do you? There are plenty of people who don't. They are happy with the immersive, wholistic experience. In this book we will be a lot more critical than that!

You need to consider the audiences when programming.
